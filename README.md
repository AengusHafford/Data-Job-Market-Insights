### ðŸ“Œ Skill Demand by Job Title

**Question:**  
What are the most in-demand skills for each job title based on the percentage of job postings mentioning them?

**Purpose:**  
This query calculates the percentage of postings that mention a specific skill for each job title â€” allowing us to rank the most relevant skills by role. An "All Postings" category is also included to show general trends across the entire dataset.

FROM title_perc

UNION ALL

SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY job_title_short ORDER BY perc DESC) AS rnk
FROM total_perc
ORDER BY job_title_short, perc DESC;
```
