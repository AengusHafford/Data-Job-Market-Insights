### ðŸ“Œ Skill Demand by Job Title

**Question:**  
What are the most in-demand skills for each job title based on the percentage of job postings mentioning them?

**Purpose:**  
This query calculates the percentage of postings that mention a specific skill for each job title â€” allowing us to rank the most relevant skills by role. An "All Postings" category is also included to show general trends across the entire dataset.

### ðŸ“Œ Skill Demand Over Time


**Question:**  
How has the demand for the top 25 most in-demand skills changed over time by job title?


**Purpose:**  
This query tracks the monthly percentage of job postings that mention each of the top 25 skills, broken out by job title and aggregated across all postings. It helps visualize trends and shifts in skill relevance across roles and over time.

### ðŸ“Œ Average Salary by Skill

**Question:**  
Which of the top 25 most in-demand skills are associated with the highest average salaries by job title?

**Purpose:**  
This query joins salary data with skill demand to calculate the average salary for each of the top 25 skills per job title. An "All Postings" category is also included to show general trends in skill-value alignment across the entire job market.

### ðŸ“Œ Remote and Degree Requirement Percentages

**Question:**  
What percentage of job postings are remote, and what percentage mention a degree requirement â€” by job title and overall?

**Purpose:**  
This query calculates two separate percentages for each job title (and overall):  
1. The share of postings that are remote vs. non-remote  
2. The share of postings that mention a degree requirement vs. those that do not  

These breakdowns help illustrate how flexible different job roles are in terms of location and education expectations.

### ðŸ“Œ Average and Median Salary by Job Title

**Question:**  
What is the average and median salary for each job title, and how does it compare to the overall average across all postings?

**Purpose:**  
This query calculates both the average and median salary for each job title in the dataset, including a benchmark value across all postings. It enables quick comparison of compensation levels by role.
